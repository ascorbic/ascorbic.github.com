            I'm a multi-skilled founder, CTO and coder, as happy roadmapping a new product line, working on a full stack Node/Angular application
            or flipping bits on an AVR microprocessor. I have worked as a CTO, founder, project manager and product owner,
            but most of all I love creating things, whether that's a startup, an app, an open source library or something
            hacked together on an Arduino or Raspberry Pi.

            <h3><span>Founder</span><a href='https://www.vela.io'>Vela Labs</a><span>May 2014 – current</span></h3>
            <p>Founder and sole employee, developing the fastest camera flashes and triggers in the world. Took the company
                from initial concept, through six months of R&amp;D, to a 200%-funded Kickstarter campaign and several rounds
                of production. I performed all technical R&amp;D and user research, commissioned electronic and industrial
                design and wrote the firmware. I then planned, promoted and managed the Kickstarter campaign, including press
                handling, and successfuly claimed R&amp;D tax credits. Currently I handle relations with manufacturers and
                customers, as well as logistics and stock control, while researching new products.
            </p>

            <h3><span>Founder</span><a href='https://www.beetight.com/'>Beetight</a><span>April 2010 – current</span></h3>
            <p>The world's leading web and mobile record keeping SaaS app for beekeepers. Originally a side-project developed
                because I had started keeping bees and found nothing that did the job, it now has tens of thousands of active
                users, with more than 10% paying a regular subscription.</p>

            <h3><span>CTO</span><span>Triggertrap</span><span>Jan 2012 – May 2014</span></h3>
            <p>Joining after a successful Kickstarter campaign, I conceived and developed Triggertrap Mobile, an app and hardware
                accessory for triggering SLR cameras from an iOS or Android device, which became the company's main revenue
                stream, taking the company into profit in the first year. I wrote the first versions of the iOS and Android
                apps, then recruited and managed a team of five full-time developers and QA engineers. Launched new apps
                and hardware devices with hundreds of thousands of paying users around the world.</p>

            <h3><span>Co-founder</span><span>CLEVR</span><span>Apr 2008 – Jan 2012</span></h3>
            <p>Developing enterprise emergency planning and mapping web and desktop apps, mostly based on Flex/Adobe Air.</p>

            <h3><span>Co-founder</span><span>Sphex</span><span>Jul 2004 – Apr 2008</span></h3>
            <p>Building a panoramic photography authoring and hosting platform. This included a web-based photo stitcher and
                panorama viewer. I performed all development, mostly part-time around my studies.</p>


            <h3><span>Lead developer</span><span>Piradian</span><span>Nov 2003 – Sep 2004</span></h3>
            <p>Spin-off from Clementine, performing R&amp;D on panoramic stitching software. I managed a small team of developers
                and machine vision specialists.</p>

            <h3><span>Co-founder</span><span>Clementine Media</span><span>Feb 2000 – Nov 2003</span></h3>

            <p>My first startup. We created content and software related to QuickTime VR panoramas, including a hosting platform
                which used a custom MVC PHP framework. I developed most of the software, but later managed a team of three
                developers.

            <h3><span>Head pastry chef</span><span>Riverstation</span><span>Dec 1996 – Feb 2000</span></h3>
            <p>I left school at 16 because I wanted to become a chef. I first worked as a baker, went to catering college and
                became a pastry chef, working my way up to head pastry chef at a busy fine dining restaurant. I retired in
                glory at the age of 20 because my love of coding was greater even than my love of profiteroles.

            <p>An ongoing, unreleased project to assemble data on waste and recycling collection days for every address in the
                UK, and publish it with a free API and downloadable open data. This has involved making hundreds of freedom
                of information requests to councils across the UK. The data is delivered in many different formats, so I
                create a definition for each and have created a command line parser in Typescript which transforms it into
                a standard CSV format. These are loaded into Cloud SQL, along with the tens of millions of records in the
                Ordnance Survey AddressBase dataset. The Express-based API allows clients to fetch collection data by address,
                postcode or authority. An SPA frontend provides an interface for end users to search. All parts of the app
                are written in Typescript. The plan is eventually to create an Alexa skill and chat bots based on the API.</p>
            <h3><a href='http://onmyway.chat'>On My Way</a><span>Alexa skill</span><span>Apr 2017</span></h3>

            </div>
            <p>An Alexa skill to find live train times and plan journeys. I found the official National Rail skill to be awkward
                and unintuitive to use, so I built a new one. The skill consumes multiple APIs to check live train times
                and perform routing. The voice model is quite complex, in order to allow users flexibility in how they ask
                for times. Other challenges were recognising thousands of station names, including those with ambiguous pronunciations
                or nicknames. The app is implemented as a series of microservices, mostly Node.js on AWS Lambda. I wanted
                to show live departure boards, but Alexa doesn't allow display of formatted text within the companion app,
                so these are implemented as images generated dynamically on the fly, using AWS Lambda running behind AWS
                API Gateway. All code was written in TypeScript and transpiled to Javascript to run on Node.</p>

            <p>The new mobile app for Beetight was a complete rewrite, as the old app was seven years old with a lot of technical
                debt. I implemented it as an Ionic 2/Angular app on top of Cordova/Phonegap. It uses several native plugins
                that I developed.</p>

            <p>Vela Pop is a high-performance sound trigger for cameras and flashes. I concieved the product and managed the
                project. I commissioned the electronics design, identified all suppliers and manufacturing partners, wrote
                the firmware and do the final assembly myself. Initially developed as an accessory for the Vela One, it is
                now also the most popular trigger for space launch photographers, with customers including SpaceX, NASA and
                dozens of independent launch photographers. Every space launch in the US has several Vela Pop triggers on
                the launchpad and surrounding area.

            <p>Vela One is the fastest camera flash in the world. The world's first high-speed LED flash, it is fast enough
                to freeze a supersonic bullet in flight. Customers include photographers around the world, but it has found
                a wider use in diverse commercial, scientific and research applications. Users include the FBI Labs, NASA
                Jet Propulsion Lab, Sandia National Labs, UK Defence Science and Technology Labs (DSTL), as well as universities
                and enterprises around the world.

            <p>This app allows a connected SLR camera to be triggered based on lots of different inputs, including sound, vibration
                and motion, as well as timed triggering for several timelapse modes. This is a complicated app, which uses
                many low-level hardware features and sensors. I wrote the first version of the apps for iOS and Android -
                native for iOS and initially Cordova for Android then ported to native. I eventually managed a team of five
                developers and testers working on the apps, and continued to do so until I left the company in 2014. The
                apps are now open source, after Triggertrap closed in January 2017.</p>

                A tool that allowed potential customers of Dow's solar roof shingles to calculate their estimated earnings. Queried a web
                service provided by Dow to find subsidies and sunlight levels for a zip code. The app included complex pixel-perfect
                animated graphs recreated from Photoshop mockups provided by the client, and many client-side calculations
                based on provided formulas. Dow has exited the solar power business, so unfortunately this is no longer live.

                I made this as a project to learn Node. The web app allowed Twitter users to quickly delete old tweets in bulk. At the time,
                similar tools took hours to delete large numbers of tweets. Using Node meant this could be done in seconds.
                Used Connect middleware, and Socket.IO to stream live updates of the progress. No longer live, but I released
                it as open source.</p>
