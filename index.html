            I'm a multi-skilled founder, CTO and senior developer, as happy roadmapping a new product line, working on a full stack Node/Angular
            application or flipping bits on a microprocessor. Creative and entrepreneurial, I love startups and creating
            new products and businesses. I'm also a trained pastry chef, certified beer judge and can brew a decent flat white.

                from initial concept, through six months of R&amp;D, to a 200%-funded Kickstarter campaign and several rounds
                of production. I performed all technical R&amp;D and user research, commissioned electronic and industrial
                design and wrote the firmware. I then planned, promoted and managed the Kickstarter campaign, including press
                handling, and successfuly claimed R&amp;D tax credits. Currently I handle relations with manufacturers and
                customers, as well as logistics and stock control, while researching new products.

                create a definition for each and have created a command line parser in Typescript which transforms it into

                are written in Typescript. The plan is eventually to create an Alexa skill and chat bots based on the API.</p>

                and perform routing. The voice model is quite complex, in order to allow users flexibility in how they ask
                for times. Other challenges were recognising thousands of station names, including those with ambiguous pronunciations
                or nicknames. The app is implemented as a series of microservices, mostly Node.js on AWS Lambda. I wanted
                to show live departure boards, but Alexa doesn't allow display of formatted text within the companion app,
                so these are implemented as images generated dynamically on the fly, using AWS Lambda running behind AWS
                API Gateway. All code was written in TypeScript and transpiled to Javascript to run on Node.</p>

            <p class='full'>Studied for a degree as a mature student, as I had left school at 16. Admitted to an AAB-offer course with no
                A Levels based on personal statement and interview. Gained a 2:1. Mostly was a break from tech, but I did
                build a web-based game to model iterated prisoner's dilemmas as part of my studies in game theory, which
                was later added to the course syllabus.
